I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Birmingham, where my research focuses on detecting and understanding gravitational waves. I work with both pulsar timing arrays and ground-based interferometers, combining complementary approaches to open new windows onto the gravitational-wave universe.

I am a member of the [NANOGrav](https://nanograv.org) collaboration, which searches for low-frequency gravitational waves using millisecond pulsars as ultra-precise cosmic clocks, and of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://ligo.org), which operates the LIGO detectors that first observed gravitational waves in 2015.

Before joining Birmingham in 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University, where I co-led searches for supermassive black hole binaries in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. I earned my PhD in Physics at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, focusing on gravitational-wave astrophysics with pulsar timing arrays, and earlier completed my MSc and BSc in Physics at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary.
